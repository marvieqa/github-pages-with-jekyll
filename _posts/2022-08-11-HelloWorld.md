## We're also Santa Claus!
Why did you bring us here? You're going to do his laundry? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Why did you bring us here? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

### Bite my shiny metal ass.
Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

1. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.
2. Bender, we're trying our best.
3. Oh God, what have I done?
